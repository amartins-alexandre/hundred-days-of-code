# DAY 1

Today, I'm asking ChatGPT to create challenges with increasing levels of difficulty for me to do using the Python language.
The first six are the ones I did in this code.

# Challenges

1. Write a program that prints "Hello World!" on the screen.
2. Write a program that asks the user for their name and then prints 
3. Write a program that calculates the sum of two integers entered b the user and prints the result.
4. Write a program that verify if a number entered by the user is even or odd.
5. Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints it inverted.
6. Write a program that determines if a string entered by the user is a palindrome.

# Resources

* `Challenge 2`: [how to capture data entered by the user?](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp)
* `Challenge 5`: [How to reverse string in python?](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_howto_reverse_string.asp)
* `Challenge 6:` [What's the palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome#Names)?

# Conclusion
In this first day of my hundred days of code challenge, I successfully completed the first six challenges using the Python language. These challenges allowed me to practice basic programming concepts such as printing messages, capturing user input, performing calculations, manipulating strings, and checking for palindromes. I found the resources provided for challenges 2, 5, and 6 particularly helpful in understanding how to capture user input, reverse a string, and determine if a string is a palindrome. I'm excited to continue this challenge and further enhance my programming skills.
