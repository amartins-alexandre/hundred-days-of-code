## About

In this project, I will be tackling coding challenges and exercises in Python to enhance my problem-solving abilities and strengthen my understanding of the language. Each day, I will work on a new challenge and document my progress.

## Challenges

The challenges will cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and more. I will be using various online platforms, coding websites, and resources to find these challenges.

## Progress

I will update my progress regularly in the README file of each day's folder. Each day, I will add a new entry to the progress section, documenting the challenge I worked on, the concepts I learned and any code snippets or solutions I found.

## Resources

Throughout this project, I will be utilizing a variety of resources to aid my learning and problem-solving process. These may include online tutorials, documentation, books, and other helpful materials. I will list these resources in the resources section in the README file of each day's folder.

## Contributing

As this is a personal project, contributions are not expected. However, if you have any suggestions, feedback, or interesting coding challenges to share, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
