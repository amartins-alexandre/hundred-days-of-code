# Day 5: Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to day five of the 100 days of code challenge! 
Today, we will be exploring various algorithms and data structures. 
Understanding these concepts is crucial for efficient problem-solving and software development.

I'm excited to dive into these challenges and expand our knowledge. 

Let's get started!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concepts of 
    - median and how to calculate it.
    - Quick Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.
    - Merge Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.
    - Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
    - Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.


## Challenges
1. **Median Calculation**
    - Write a program that implements a function to calculate the median of a list of numbers.

2. **Quick Sort**
    - Write a program that implements the Quick Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.

3. **Merge Sort**
    - Write a program that implements the Merge Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.

4. **Shortest Path using Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
    - Write a program that implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

5. **Shortest Path using Dijkstra Algorithm**
    - Write a program that implements the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
