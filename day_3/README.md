# DAY 3

At day 3 of the challenge focuses on various programming tasks. It includes challenges such as described below in the challenges section. 
The resources provided offer additional information and guidance for each challenge.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice working with lists and strings
- Implement common algorithms such as binary search and linear search
- Understand mathematical concepts such as averages, prime numbers, and combinations
- Learn about Newton's method for finding square roots
- Explore additional resources for further learning and understanding


# Challenges

1. Write a program that calculates the averange of the number in a lista inserted by the user.
2. Write a programa that implements a binary search in a ordered list of numbers inserted by the user.
3. Write a program that determines if a string inserted by the user is a pangram.
4. Write a program that get everthings prime numbers until a limit inserted by the user.
5. Write a program that implements a function for calculate a numbers of combination of 'n' objects  taken from 'r' in 'r'.
6. Write a program that implements a function for calculate a square root of the number using the Newton's method.
7. Write a program that implements a linear search in the inserted list by the user.
