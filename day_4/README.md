# Day 4: Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to day four of the 100 days of code challenge! Today, I'm going to dive into the fantastic world of algorithms and data structures.
Their use is very important, and understanding their concepts is exceptional for implementation in your favorite language.
I was very excited to increase my knowledge, and these challenges were amazing.

I can't wait for the next challenges. Come with me on this quest for knowledge.

Let's rock!


## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of binary representation and conversion from decimal to binary.
- Implement the calculation of moving average for a given list of numbers.
- Implement breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal.
- Implement depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for graph traversal.
- Calculate the scalar product of two vectors.

## Challenges
1. Write a program that converts a decimal number inserted by the user into binary.
2. Write a program that implements a function to calculate the moving average of a list of numbers.
3. Write a program that implements a breadth-first search (BFS) in a graph represented by adjacency lists.
4. Write a program that implements a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph represented by adjacency lists.
5. Write a program that implements a function to calculate the scalar product of two vectors.
